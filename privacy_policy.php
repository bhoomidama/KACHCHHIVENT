When we display your submissions, we do so together with your account name (first name and last initial). The term "submissions" refers to the information that you submit or post to Kachchhivent for public display, such as business ratings, reviews, photos, compliments, and the information that you display as part of your account profile.

If you contact us to provide feedback, register a complaint, or ask a question, we will record any personal information and other content that you provide in your communication so that we can effectively respond to your communication.

            <p class=""><h2> 2. Controlling your personal data</h2><br>
                To the extent you include personal information in your submissions (such as a photo of yourself), third parties may be able to identify you, associate you with your user account, and contact you. Third parties can also associate you with your user account using the member lookup feature on Kachchhivent, but only if the third party already knows your full name and you include information in your submission that allows the third party to distinguish you from other users who might share the same full name. Please do not include information in your submissions that you expect to keep private. In addition, you can reduce the risk of being personally identified by choosing a fictitious account name, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your submissions. As a registered Kachchhivent user, you can modify some of your personal information and your privacy preferences by accessing the "Account" section of this website. For example, you may choose not to receive e-mail solicitations from Kachchhivent by accessing the "Account" tab on Kachchhivent(after signing in) and updating your newsletter/notification settings.</p>
